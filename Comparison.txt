Comparison between hadoop/java and spark/scala - 
I found hadoop easy to program and understand than spark probably beacuse of difficult syntax of scala.
but it took very less time (at least order of 10x) for spark to generate output especially noticeable with large graph file 
which generates 11 MB output. Probably because the intermediate data is stored in main memory as opposed to disk in case of hadoop.
